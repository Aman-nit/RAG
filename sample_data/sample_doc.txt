Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
        that are programmed to think and act like humans. The term may also be applied 
        to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning 
        and problem-solving.
        
        Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically 
        learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning 
        focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
        
        Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that has networks 
        capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. It is also 
        known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.
